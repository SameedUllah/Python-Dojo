# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['john', 'paul','sara','william']

# for loop
# for person in people:
#     if person == 'sara':
#         print(f'Reaached @ {person}')
#         break
#     print(F'Current Person {person}')

# Break
# for person in people:
#     if person == 'sara':
#         break
#     print(F'Current Person {person}')

# Continue
# for person in people:
#     if person == 'sara':
#         continue
#     print(F'Current Person {person}')

# Range
# for i in range(len(people)):
#     print(people[i])

for i in range (0,11):
    print(f'the number is {i}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
